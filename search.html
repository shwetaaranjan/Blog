                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
                (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text 
                to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of
                tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, 
                client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce 
                development.</p>

                <p>A novel is a long, fictional narrative. The novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose style. 
                The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing, and the introduction of
                cheap paper in the 15th century.The earliest novels include classical Greek and Latin prose narratives from the first 
                century BC to the second century AD, such as Chariton's Callirhoe (mid 1st century), which is "arguably the earliest
                surviving Western novel, as well as Petronius' Satyricon, Lucian's True Story, Apuleius' The Golden Ass, and the
                anonymous Aesop Romance and Alexander Romance. </p>
